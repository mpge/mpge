  Hey, I’m Matt. I’ve been building and shipping software for 14+ years professionally (much earlier as a hobby) across a wide range of stacks, industries, and problem spaces. I hold the contempt of being able to say I learnt code out of textbooks in my teens, wrote it on a piece of paper, only to try it out on my computer later. Things have changed.

## 🚀 Flagship Platforms

### Escalated
**Escalated** is an embeddable support and ticketing platform built for modern product teams that want enterprise-grade workflows without enterprise drag.

**Strategic focus**
- **Embeddable-first**: drop-in support portals and admin surfaces  
- **Workflow intelligence**: SLAs, escalation rules, ownership, and auditability  
- **Framework-agnostic**: Laravel, Rails, Django, and API-first consumers  
- **Flexible deployment**: cloud, self-hosted, or hybrid  

> North Star: transform support from a reactive cost center into a measurable, scalable system.

### Inventoros
**Inventoros** is a modular operations and inventory platform focused on warehouse and fulfillment workflows. It’s positioned as a composable operations layer rather than a rigid monolith.

**Positioning**
- Workflow-native inventory movements and adjustments  
- Integration-first architecture with clean data contracts  
- Performance- and scale-aware by design
